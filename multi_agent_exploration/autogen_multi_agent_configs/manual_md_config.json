November had 3 showings total, summing to 600+400+600 showings total.\r\nCommentary: This is fairly straightforward as we simply sum all rows sharing the same month.\r\n\r\nHarder Example: How many total showings were there in each month?\r\n\r\ndate\r\nterritory\r\nshowings\r\nnotes\r\noctober 20, 2006\r\nturkey\r\n200\r\nOpening day in Turkey\r\nnovember 21, 2006\r\nbelgium\r\n600\r\nOpening day in Belgium\r\nthe week after opening day\r\nturkey\r\n400\r\n\r\n\r\nnovember 23, 2006\r\nbelgium\r\n600\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer: October 2006 had 600 showings, while November had 1,200\r\nAnswer Rationale: In Turkey, the week after opening day fell in the month of October, therefore there were 200 (from opening day) + 400 (from the week after) = 600 showings in October. November had 600+600 = 1,200 showings, all from Belgium.\r\nCommentary: We introduce a cross-row dependency here that requires temporal reasoning to solve. Namely, we need to intuit that, given opening day is on October 20th, the week immediately following it must fall within the month of October. Again, we intentionally edit the values in the table (and add a \u2018notes\u2019 column) to ensure that the answer (600 in October, 1200 in November) necessarily required resolving this cross-row dependency.",

November had 600*$1000 = $600,000 from Belgium and 400*$1000 = $400,000 from Turkey, totalling $1,000,000. November 22 had 600 * $500 = $300,000 in sales.\r\nCommentary: This reasoning requires calculating values over two different columns, and then additionally summing values over associated rows (e.g. the november 21 entries).",

Ferrari\u2019s wins were exclusively in conditions with dry pavement, whereas Renault won only in wet conditions.\r\nAnswer Rationale: Ferrari had three wins, and Renault had two wins. The rest of the teams had only one. Notably, Ferrari winning races were only in conditions where the roads were presumably dry (sunny+dry, sunny, and overcast), and Renault\u2019s wins were only on day where the conditions were wet (slick roads, and damp).\r\nCommentary: This answer requires not only understanding the winning teams, but also realizing that there were patterns in the conditions for both teams. Namely, one had to ascertain that Ferrari performed well on dry days, whereas Renault did well on wet roads. This requires aggregating, comparing, and contrasting values across different rows and teams.\r\n",

However, the final row contains sales information that implicitly refers to a country. We see that this country is already mentioned and that this row is a follow-up to a previous entry with sales numbers. The sales value is $195,000 which is stated as 60k more than the prior day sales. We can use this to ascertain what the country is. Namely, we see that there are two entries for the prior day (October 25). Of these two, Germany\u2019s sales were $134,000 which is approximately $60,000 less than $195,000. Belgium\u2019s sales were much lower (over $150k less than $195,000). Therefore, we can reasonably conclude that the October 26 entry in mention refers to Germany. Combining the $134,000 from October 25 and $195,000 from October 26, we see Germany\u2019s total sales are $329,000, which is less than the United Kingdom, but more than Turkey.\r\nCommentary: This problem requires that one notices that the final row can be linked to a prior row. Once this is done, there is some soft reasoning that clearly leads to the proper solution. So, while there is some abduction reasoning required, it is very clear once you put the pieces together.\r\n",
