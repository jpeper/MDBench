  "Resultant Generated Answer": "cheng fei ( chn ), sandra izba\u00e5\u00ffa ( rou ), nastia liukin ( usa ), shawn johnson ( usa ), daiane santos ( bra ), ekaterina kramarenko ( rus ), anna pavlova ( rus ), jiang yuyuan ( chn )",

  "Example Difficulty": "{\"multi-hop\": 4, \"temporal\": 1, \"numeric\": 3, \"information_aggregation\": 4, \"soft_reasoning\": 5}",

  "Validity Scalar": 2,

  "Validity Rationale": "The reasoning process and final ranked list are mostly consistent, but there are significant issues that affect the validity and reliability of the example. First, the introduction of a duplicate entry for 'nastia liukin ( usa )' with different scores creates ambiguity. The obfuscation to '<usa gymnast>' and the inference that it corresponds to 'nastia liukin ( usa )' without clear justification is problematic. This could lead to incorrect assumptions and interpretations. Additionally, the final ranked list does not account for ties properly (e.g., 'nastia liukin ( usa )' and 'shawn johnson ( usa )' both have a total score of 15.4). Overall, the example has logical gaps and inconsistencies that reduce its validity.",

  "Ambiguity Scalar": 1,

  "Ambiguity Rationale": "The candidate solution presents a clear and comprehensive approach to ranking the gymnasts based on their total scores. It correctly accounts for ties by listing gymnasts with the same score together. There is only one viable interpretation of the solution, which is the ranking of gymnasts by their total scores from highest to lowest. Therefore, the question does not exhibit significant ambiguity due to multiple solutions.",

  "Example Difficulty Rationale": "\"The example requires multi-hop reasoning to sum scores correctly, numeric reasoning to compare scores, information aggregation to link rows with obfuscated information, and soft reasoning to interpret indirect references. There is minimal temporal reasoning involved.\"",
